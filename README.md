# AI Brief Pipeline

### One editorial task. Multiple models. Inspectable results.

This pipeline tests and compares AI models for [Max’s AI Brief](https://maxsaibrief.com/), the production daily AI newsletter. This repository shares the testing results: how different models turn a shared pool of news evidence into a briefing, which stories and posts they select, how their short-form writing is judged, how long their workflows take, and what their recorded token usage would cost at published API rates.

The aim is to make the trade-offs visible - not to declare a universal winner.

## Explore the results

- **[Model comparisons](model-comparison/)** - Where models agree, where they diverge, and which stories and posts each selects. Daily consensus scores measure selection agreement, not factual accuracy.
- **[Pulse judging](pulse-judging/)** - Blind, multi-judge evaluation of each model’s **AI Industry Pulse** summary. Model identities are removed and labels are shuffled separately for each judge. Explore daily scores, judge notes, self-preference checks, the [cumulative leaderboard](pulse-judging/LEADERBOARD.md), and the [judging prompt](pulse-judging/PROMPT.md).
- **[Token costs](token-costs/)** - Recorded input, output, and cache usage, with API-equivalent estimates kept separate from provider-billed charges.
- **[Summaries](summary/)** - The cross-day view: consensus, estimated cost, elapsed time, total tokens, and effective cost per token.
- **[API prices](api-prices/)** - The saved pricing reference for the models in the comparison, including context tiers, cache rates, source links, and observed update dates.
- **[Daily results](daily-results/)** - The generated HTML editions themselves, organized by day and model. Read the outputs behind the scores.

## Two different lenses on the output

**Consensus asks: “Did the models choose the same news?”** Pulse judging asks: **“How did the summaries perform against an editorial rubric?”** These are separate measures. Agreement does not prove accuracy, and a judge’s score is an evaluation - not an objective truth.

Read both alongside the actual editions, execution times, and costs. Shared starting evidence improves comparability, but does not make every session, runtime instruction, or follow-up research step identical. Daily reports document their scope and limitations.

## Follow the evidence

Readable reports sit at the top of each reporting directory. Supporting JSON audits live in each reporting directory’s `json/` subdirectory, including `pulse-judging/json/`. Pulse Judging’s readable daily reports live in `pulse-judging/daily/`.

- [Archive notes](docs/archive-notes.md) explain selection rules and exceptions.
- [Import manifest](docs/import-manifest.json) records the original imported source paths and SHA-256 hashes.

This repository is a reporting and results archive, not a complete runnable distribution of the production newsletter pipeline.
